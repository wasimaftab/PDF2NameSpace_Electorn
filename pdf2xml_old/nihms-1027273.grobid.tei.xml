<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Pancreatic islets provide the endocrine function of the pancreas and are comprised of at least five hormone-producing cell types: Î± cells (secreting glucagon, GCG), Î² cells (insulin, INS), Î³/PP cells (pancreatic polypeptide, PPY), Î´ cells (somatostatin, SST), and Îµ cells (ghrelin, GHRL). Malfunction of pancreatic islets, especially Î² cells, is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, because obesity and T2D are two highly related diseases (i.e., many patients have both diseases), understanding the commonality and differences between the two diseases at cellular level is challenging. Conventional transcriptome analysis requires pure endocrine cell subpopulations from a large number of patients to achieve statistical significance, which can be prohibitively difficult.</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies allow transcriptome profiling in individual cells and are revolutionizing the analyses of rare or complex tissues, including pancreatic islets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baron et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dorajoo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lawlor et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Li et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Muraro et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Segerstolpe et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Xin et al., 2016)</ref>. However, although these previous studies have clearly demonstrated the great potential of scRNA-seq in islet biology, limitations remain. First, most of these studies only analyzed up to a few hundred cells from each donor, therefore had low sensitivity mapping rare cell subpopulations. Second, due to the limited availability of human islet samples, especially from diabetic patients, the sensitivity of detecting disease relevant gene signatures is low. Finally, the cellular functions of identified signature genes remain to be validated.</p><p>In this study, we used Drop-Seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Macosko et al., 2015)</ref> to generate massively parallel singlecell transcriptome data from thousands of islet cells. The improved throughput allowed us to map the heterogeneity of endocrine cell subpopulations sensitively. Importantly, even though there is no Î± or Î² cell subpopulation correlated with obesity or T2D, we observed obvious trajectories of continuous cellular heterogeneity associated with diseases. We therefore developed a general single-cell analysis algorithm named RePACT (regressing principle components for the alignment of continuous trajectory) and demonstrated that it is feasible to identify both common and specific signature genes associated with obesity and T2D with a limited supply of human islets. Additionally, we also used an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screen to validate the insulin regulatory functions of disease signature genes. Our integrative analyses uncovered previously uncharacterized Î²-cell-specific insulin regulator modules, including the MAU2-NIPBL cohesin loading complex, and the NuA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex. Taken together, our study provides a general strategy for systematically characterizing disease genes in pancreatic islets as well as other complex tissues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drop-Seq Analysis of Human Islet Samples</head><p>We prepared Drop-Seq libraries with fresh human islet samples from 6 healthy (3 overweighed with BMI &gt;30) and 3 T2D donors (2 overweighed). In total, we obtained transcriptome data from 39,905 single cells (1,206-9,409 cells from each donor, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) and used a very stringent clustering-based analysis pipeline to determine the types of 28,026 "clean" cells without ambiguity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>; Data S1). When projecting the cells to a twodimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plot, we observed a clear distinction between endocrine cells and a few non-endocrine cell types, mainly pancreatic ductal cells (PDCs) marked by several keratin genes (KRTs), and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) marked by collagen genes <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1B and 1C)</ref>. We observed very few acinar cells marked by REG1A and PRSS1 genes, which were identified as PCA outliers but failed to form a distinct cluster in t-SNE due to the scarcity (n = 108, Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-2D</ref>). We further performed a second-round unsupervised clustering with the endocrine cells and distinguished four major endocrine clusters, which are recognized as Î±, Î², Î´, and PP cells based on the enrichment of corresponding marker genes (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>). We could not observe a distinct cluster of Îµ cells in tSNE due to the extreme scarcity of this cell type in our samples: only 13 of the 28,026 "clean" cells express the Îµ cell hormone gene GHRL . Taken together, all of the samples contain 10%-20% non-endocrine cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>), consistent with an estimated 80%-90% islet purity, and ~90% of endocrine cells in every donor are Î± or Î² cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene Signatures of Non-endocrine Cell Types</head><p>We first used a negative binomial model to define the non-endocrine cell marker genes (STAR Methods), including a number of transcription factors (TFs) that may function as master cell type regulators (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>; a complete gene list is included in Data S2). As expected, PSCs express collagen genes; ductal cells express keratins, CFTR, and TSPAN8; and exocrine acinar cells express REG1A, REG1B, REG3A, and a number of digestive enzymes <ref type="bibr">(Figures 2E and 2G)</ref>. Interestingly, we also observed duct-exclusive expression of inflammation genes such as CCL2, CXCL2, MMP7, and DEFB1 <ref type="bibr">(Figures 2E and 2G)</ref>. It is not clear whether these duct-expressed inflammatory genes may contribute to disease initiation or development, although the elevated levels of cytokines in pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer is well documented.</p><p>We observed two clusters of PSCs representing activated and quiescent populations; ~70% of PSCs are activated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Both populations contain cells from multiple donors <ref type="bibr">(comparing Figures 1B with S2A)</ref>. It is known that under quiescent state, the PSCs contain abundant lipid droplets in the cytoplasm, and pancreatic injury or other pathogenic insults can activate PSCs, leading to increased migration and proliferation, more production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, metalloproteinase (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Omary et al., 2007)</ref>. Indeed, we found that the activated PSCs expressed more collagen, TIMPs, and stem cell or cancer signature genes but lost the expression of lipid-processing or adipogenesis genes such as FABP4 and ADIRF (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene Signatures of Endocrine Cell Types</head><p>We next defined hundreds of genes specifically expressed in various endocrine cell types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>; Data S2). As expected, Î²-cell-specific genes are associated with insulin secretion and diabetes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). We identified a number of endocrine-specific transcription factors with dramatic specificity between different endocrine cell types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). For example, PAX6, NEUROD1, and INSM1 are expressed in all four, and MAFB is expressed in three endocrine cell types. Our top list includes many classically known cell identity master transcription factors, such as PDX1, MAFA, and NKX6-1 in Î² cells, ARX and IRX2 in Î± cells, and HHEX in Î´ cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). Consistent with a few other singlecell results <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baron et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lawlor et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Segerstolpe et al., 2016)</ref>, we also observed dual specificity of PDX1 (Î² and Î´) and ARX (Î± and PP). Some signaling-dependent TFs are also cell-type-specific, such as ESR1 (Î² cell) and EGR2, EGR3, and STAT4 (PP cell) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). These signal-dependent TFs may have important physiological functions. For example, studies in both human and mouse have shown that the activation of estrogen receptor Î± (ESR1) protects Î² cells from apoptosis and preserves functional Î² cell mass in diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Tiano and Mauvais-Jarvis, 2012)</ref>. Diabetes and obesity are two complex multigene disorders contributed by many tissues. We collected over 1,000 GWAS risk genes (Data S3) and reasoned that knowing their expression pattern in endocrine cells, especially Î² cells, would be helpful for the understanding the disease etiology. We found 163 GWAS risk genes specifically expressed in one or more endocrine cell types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>; Data S3) including some well-known Î² cell genes RNF6, PDX1, SLC2A2, MEG3, and DLK1. Interestingly, a number of risk genes are Î´-cellspecific, including HHEX, LEPR, ERBB4, etc., suggesting a particularly important role of Î´ cells to diabetes or obesity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</p><p>Last, we examined the endocrine-specific cell surface genes due to their potential as cellular markers, or targets for pharmacological intervention (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>; Data S3). Interestingly, we noticed that Î´ cells specifically express several important hormone receptor genes, including LEPR (receptor of leptin), GHSR (receptor of Ghrelin), GHR (receptor of growth hormone), ERBB4 (receptor of EGF), and two GABA receptors (GABRG2 and GABRA1) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</p><p>Receptor activity is actually one of the top functional categories for the Î´-cell-specific genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). These results suggested a key regulatory role of Î´ cells by integrating multiple cell signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Segerstolpe et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identifying Î± or Î² Cell Subpopulations</head><p>Previous studies, including several recent single-cell RNA-seq analyses, have investigated Î² cell heterogeneity but reached discrepant conclusions regarding the existence of Î² cell subpopulations, partly due to the low cell numbers analyzed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gutierrez et al., 2017)</ref>. We posited that Drop-Seq would be more sensitive in resolving distinct cell populations with greatly improved throughput. In this study, we pooled Î± or Î² cells from all donors and used principle component analysis (PCA) to identify cell subpopulations as outliers (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2C</ref>) then projected the cells onto t-SNE plots to confirm their presence in multiple donors <ref type="bibr">(Figures S2D and S2E)</ref>. Marker genes for these subpopulations are listed in Data S2.</p><p>The most obvious Î± cell subpopulation consists of a small number of proliferating Î± cell expressing TOPA1, CENPF, and AURKB (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>). Importantly, proliferating Î± cell is a reproducible population that can be found from multiple donors including H1, H3, H4, H5, H6, and T2D3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E</ref>, cells in dark green). Notably, the proliferating Î± cells were also reported in another recent single-cell study but with low sensitivity due to limited cell throughput <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Segerstolpe et al., 2016)</ref>. Our study has therefore confirmed the existence of this rare Î± cell population, which may also play an important role in Î² cell replenishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Thorel et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The biggest subpopulations are Î±-HS and Î²-HS cells expressing the same set of heat shock genes including DNAJA1, <ref type="bibr">DNAJB1,</ref><ref type="bibr">HSPAs,</ref><ref type="bibr">and HSPBs,</ref><ref type="bibr">etc. (Figures 1E,</ref><ref type="bibr">2F,</ref><ref type="bibr">2G,</ref>. However, both Î±-HS and Î²-HS cells are mainly found in donor H3 and T2D3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E</ref>). Many types of stresses can activate heat shock genes (HSPs). Reduced expression of HSPs is associated with diabetes, and upregulation of HSPs may provide a cytoprotective effect to Î² cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hooper and Hooper, 2009)</ref>. Interestingly, a recent single-cell study also observed a correlation between stress gene expression and aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Enge et al., 2017)</ref>. Last, we also identified two other minor cell clusters (Î±-KCNQ1OT1 and Î²-KCNQ1OT1), both of which were exclusive to donor H5 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). More donors are necessary to evaluate the physiological relevance of these individual-specific subpopulations.</p><p>Importantly, we did not find any of these subpopulations correlate with the BMI or T2D status of the donors, leading to a conclusion that disease-associated effect on Î± or Î² cells does not create distinctive cell subpopulations. Therefore, we excluded the minor cell populations in the following disease association analysis and focused on the continuous changes of Î± or Î² transcriptome associated with disease status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Obesity and T2D Cause Different Single-Cell Transcriptome Heterogeneity</head><p>We next investigated the molecular differences between cells from healthy, obese, and T2D donors. A few recent single-cell studies have explored this question <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lawlor et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Segerstolpe et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Xin et al., 2016)</ref>. These studies used conventional statistical models comparing cells from normal and patients and looked for differentially expressed genes correlated with disease states. However, these models do not account for cellular heterogeneity and treat all cells from the same donor equally, which may result in low sensitivity for the following reasons: (1) disease-causing cells can be too rare to be detected when a majority of cells are normal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>); and (2) the difference between normal and patient cells can be small and masked by large individual variance. In both scenarios, many human samples become necessary to increase the statistical power.</p><p>Here, we propose a strategy to improve the sensitivity to identify disease signature genes by dissecting disease-associated single-cell heterogeneity. Our strategy is based on a fundamentally different concept assuming the presence of disease relevant cellular heterogeneity from the same donor. Specifically, obesity or T2D may cause different transcriptome heterogeneity at single-cell level. Theoretically, by ranking and directly comparing cells at normal, transitional, and disease states, it is possible to improve the sensitivity even if very few donors are available (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> shows scatterplots of all the Î² cells in the space of top three principle components (PCs). Remarkably, although cells from different donors do not segregate in the PCA plots, there is a clear continuous shift correlated with BMI or T2D status. Importantly, the two disease conditions show different trajectories, indicating different effects on the transcriptome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RePACT: A Sensitive Approach to Identify Disease-Relevant Gene Signatures from Single-Cell Data</head><p>We therefore developed RePACT (regressing principle components for the assembly of continuous trajectory), to identify genes associated with disease relevant cellular heterogeneity. In this algorithm, we first performed PCA to reduce the dimension of transcriptome data. Next, we used regression analysis to draw two optimal trajectory lines reflecting the obesity-or T2D-relevant variation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> is an example when we only used the top three PCs to plot the trajectory lines. In this study, we actually used top 10 PCs as predictors (STAR Methods). The numeric projection of each cell on the obesity or T2D trajectory (BMI index and T2D index) served as a measurement of the degree to which the cell has transformed during disease development. We then binned the cells into a number of pseudostates according to the index values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). By comparing cells from different pseudo-states, RePACT greatly improved the statistical power to identify gene signatures for obesity or T2D status in Î± or Î² cell (Figures 4D and S3A-S3C; STAR Methods). To evaluate the robustness of RePACT method, we called top 200 T2D signature genes in Î± or Î² cells using data from all three T2D donors and then compared them to the results when only two T2D donors were included (dropout analyses). We found that 91%-95% of the T2D signature genes can be recovered from at least two of the three dropout analyses (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3D-S3E</ref>), proving that the signature genes identified from RePACT were highly reproducible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RePACT Identifies Common and Specific Î² Cell Gene Signatures Associated with Obesity and T2D</head><p>We identified 1,368 T2D trajectory genes and 1,188 obesity trajectory genes in Î² cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>; Data S4). It is known that obesity increases diabetes risk, and as expected, the two signatures shared many common genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>). For example, GAPDH, IAPP, SPP1, and CPE are downregulated in both obesity and T2D trajectories (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>). GAPDH is a key enzyme for glycolysis and glucose metabolism. IAPP, SPP1, and CPE are all well-known diabetes or obesity risk genes. Particularly, IAPP forms islet amyloid, which is linked to cellular toxicity in T2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clark and Nilsson, 2004)</ref>; SPP1 mediates the obesityinduced macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue and insulin resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nomiyama et al., 2007)</ref>; and CPE is important for proinsulin processing and its mutation leads to obesity and hyperproinsuline-mia in mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Naggert et al., 1995)</ref>. With the single-cell trajectory data, we also determined the transcription dynamics of 149 GWAS risk genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A</ref>), which may help the dissection of etiology of obesity or T2D.</p><p>Most interestingly, we found many genes specific to one trajectory but not the other, including genes with opposite trends in the two trajectories (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>). The best example is probably the insulin gene (INS) itself, which is upregulated in obesity (consistent with the hyperinsulinemia in obesity) but downregulated in T2D (consistent with the Î² cell dysfunction in T2D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Marchetti et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Templeman et al., 2017)</ref>. On the contrary, two ferritin genes (FTL and FTH1) are downregulated in obesity but upregulated in T2D (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>). Ferritin is the major intracellular iron storage protein. Clinical results have shown that low-serum iron concentration is associated with obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lecube et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nead et al., 2004)</ref>, while iron overload is a risk factor for T2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Simcox and McClain, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Another interesting observation is that although only 15 obesity-upregulated genes are downregulated in T2D (including INS), many more (99) obesity-downregulated genes shift their trends in to upregulation in T2D (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>). We therefore performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on genes with common or opposite trends in obesity or T2D (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>). For example, consistent with the connection to hypoxia in both T2D and BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Ye, 2009)</ref>, we found upregulation of hypoxia, glycolysis, and HIF1A target genes, but downregulation of aerobic respiration pathways in both trajectories (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>). Surprisingly, the proteasome genes or pathway are elevated in T2D but downregulated in obesity trajectory (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>). Polymorphisms at proteasome genes have been associated to obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kupca et al., 2013)</ref>, and proteasome activity is weakened in obese liver that can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and insulin resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Otoda et al., 2013)</ref>. However, a recent study showed that in Î² cells, the inhibition of proteasome activity improves insulin production <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Weisberg et al., 2016)</ref>. Our results therefore suggest an important mechanism that is differentially presented in obesity and T2D governing Î² cell function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Genome-Wide Gene Deletion Analysis to Identify Insulin Regulators</head><p>The primary functions of Î² cell are to produce, store, and secrete insulin. Although we have identified a number of signature genes in Î² cells with Drop-Seq, the remaining question is whether these genes affect Î² cell functions. To address this problem, we decided to perform an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify insulin regulators. We choose to use the MIN6 insulinoma cell because it is one of the most robust Î² cell lines for the study of glucose sensing and insulin secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Skelin et al., 2010)</ref>. Although MIN6 is a mouse cell line, and the functions of screen hits eventually need to be test in native human islets, we reasoned that most of the mouse insulin-regulatory genes should have conserved functions with their human orthologs. Therefore, the genome-wide mouse CRISPR data should still serve the purpose of providing an additional layer of information about gene functions.</p><p>Briefly, we packaged a lentiviral library using the mouse GeCKOv2 single guide RNA (sgRNA) library that contains ~130 K sgRNAs (6 sgRNAs per protein-coding gene in the mouse genome), and transduced &gt;100 million MIN6 cells at low MOI so that most cells were infected with only one virus. After 7 days of puromycin selection expansion of transduced cells, we fixed and permeabilized the cells and sorted ~200 million cells based on the intracellular insulin protein level (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>; STAR Methods). Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated an increased variation of the insulin signal among the infected cells, suggesting that the screen has successfully targeted both positive and negative insulin regulators (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>). We collected top (Ins Hi ) and bottom (Ins Lo ) 10% cells and amplified the sgRNA sequences from integrated viral DNA for next generation sequencing. By comparing the abundance of each sgRNA in the two cell populations, we can determine the effect of target genes on insulin level in the cells.</p><p>We performed two independent screens and called hit sgRNAs only if they are reproducible between two replicates. Based on their significance and reproducibility, (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>; STAR Methods), we classified hit sgRNAs into five tiers (tier one sgRNAs have p &lt; 0.001 in both replicates, false discover rate [FDR] = 0.1) and called 373 hit genes with at least one tier-one sgRNA. The design of sgRNA redundancy (6 sgRNAs per gene) also allowed us to evaluate the off-target risk for all hit genes from the screen. We found that most tier-one hit genes (223 of 373, or 59.8%) are supported by two or more sgRNAs (Data S5). However, the more likely reason for a sgRNA to fail the significance test is its under-representation in the GeCKO sgRNA library: the concentration of most abundant sgRNAs can be over 100-fold higher than the low-abundance ones (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5E</ref>). Therefore, in this study, we choose to report all tier 1 genes, but also divide tier 1 hit genes into sub tiers to indicate if they are supported by multiple sgRNAs: 1A (119 genes, â¥3 supporting sgRNAs, FDR = 0.001), 1B (104 genes, 2 supporting sgRNAs, FDR = 0.038), and 1C (150 genes, 1 supporting sgRNA, FDR = 0.28). Note that there is a significant off-target risk for Tier 1C genes because they only have one supporting sgRNA (STAR Methods). Proteins from the same complexes, such as Nelfa-Nelfb-Nelfe and Mau2-Nipbl, were often identified together, suggesting that our CRISPR screen is sensitive and robust (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>). We called a gene "positive regulator" if its' sgRNA was enriched in Ins Lo population, meaning that the gene increased the intracellular insulin amount. As expected, the strongest positive insulin regulator was Ins2, the mouse ortholog of human insulin gene INS. Conversely, we also called "negative regulators" from sgRNAs enriched in the Ins Hi population (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>).</p><p>Multiple mechanisms may regulate the intracellular insulin levels. Among the top hits (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>), we found transcriptional regulators (such as Glis3 and Nelfs), translational regulators (such as Eef2), and post-translational regulators (such as unfolded protein response regulator gene Xbp1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lee et al., 2011)</ref>. Importantly, our screen also identified regulators of insulin secretion, especially genes involved in glucose induced insulin secretion (GSIS). For example, Glp1r <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Trujillo and Nuffer, 2014)</ref>, a known GSIS regulator, was identified as one of the top negative regulators (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>). Notably, although 74 of 373 insulin regulators are also "fitness genes" (leading to slow growth upon deletion) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hart et al., 2015)</ref>, the distribution of fitness genes among positive (17 of 117, 15%) or negative insulin regulators (57 of 256, 22%) is not biased (p = 0.094, Fisher's exact test) suggesting that slow-growing cells do not cause a bias in our screen.</p><p>To validate the hits from the screen, we also infected MIN6 cells with individually cloned sgRNAs and used flow cytometry to measure the intracellular insulin levels (STAR Methods). We verified 13 out of 20 (65%) positive regulators and 30 out of 33 (91%) negative regulators (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>). We further test 20 of the verified genes with newly designed sgRNAs and re-validated 19 of them, indicating a low off-target rate (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5F</ref>). It is worth noting that our genome-wide CRISPR analysis tends to report higher fold changes than individual experiments. This is mostly likely because in the individual experiments, a significant fraction of cells did not obtain loss-of-function mutations, whereas the selection of Ins Hi and Ins Lo populations in the screen enriches the cells with successful gene knockout events. As a result, the pooled screen had a higher sensitivity, which may also explain why some CRISPR hits were not validated in the individual experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrative Analysis of Single-Cell and CRISPR Data Revealed Disease-Relevant Insulin-Regulating Modules</head><p>We performed STRING analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Szklarczyk et al., 2015)</ref> on the 373 tier-one insulin regulators and drew all the functional or physical associations between these genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>; STAR Methods). Compared to Drop-Seq data, we identified 100 insulin regulators up-or downregulated in the diabetes or obesity trajectory, including Cdkn2a, Cox7c, Glis3, and Xbp1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and S4B). Therefore, these transcriptional changes may play a causal role in the disease development. We also identified 40 insulin regulators specifically expressed in Î² cell including Glp1r. These genes may have important selective functions in Î² cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>; Data S5). Seventeen Î²-cell-specific insulin regulators also change their expression in diabetes or obesity trajectories (Atp6v1h, Bcat2, Cct8, Cdkn2a, Cops6, Dhps, Eif3e, Gnas, Ins2, Lmo2, Mrpl22, Nelfcd, Rph3al, Rtcb, Srp9, Taf7, and Xbp1) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</p><p>The network analysis also expanded the repertoire of disease relevant insulin regulators. Our analysis highlighted nine notable modules of insulin regulators; each module contains at least one diabetes or obesity signature genes in Î² cell, and all of them represent multiprotein complexes with cooperative functions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The identification of a whole protein complex from the CRISPR screen is strong evidence that the complex is key for Î² cell function. Alteration of signature genes in these complexes may influence their normal functions and contribute to the disease development. For example, the largest module is the protein translation and processing network. Most of the genes in this module are positive insulin regulators, presumably because they positively regulate insulin protein production and maturation. Negative regulators in this module, such as PP2A protein phosphatase members Ppp2r1a and Ppp2ca, may function as inhibitors of protein translation or processing.</p><p>Six protein modules appear to regulate insulin release (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>): (1) GPCR signaling complex (GPCR signal such as Glp1r amplifies insulin secretion); (2) mitochondria ATP production module (important for ATP production, therefore ATP-dependent insulin release); (3) synaptic vesicle exocytosis module (insulin release); (4) COP9 signalosome (protein ubiquitination and ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis); (5) LAMTOR Ragulator complex (late endosome or lysosome scaffold proteins); and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) chaperonins (promoting insulin secretion by assisting protein folding). Interestingly, nearly all genes in these modules are negative insulin regulators, i.e., once these genes are deleted, insulin accumulates in the cells due to the impaired secretion. The only positive regulator in these modules is Sytl4, a known inhibitor of exocytosis. Consistently, another exocytosis inhibitor Stxbp5 is also a positive insulin regulator (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). It is interesting that the endocytic modules are also negative insulin regulators, because this suggests that insulin granules require not only the exocytosis process for secretion, but also the endocytosis process to ensure vesicle recycle or membrane recapture <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(MacDonald and Rorsman, 2007)</ref>. Misregulation of either of these two trafficking pathways will lead to the failure of sustainable insulin release.</p><p>Our CRISPR screen also identified two previously unrecognized insulin regulators modules: the cohesin function module and the NuA4/Tip60 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex module (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The Î² cell functions of these two complexes are unknown, so we performed additional analyses to gain further insights into the underlying mechanisms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mau2-Nipbl Cohesin Loading Complex Regulates Insulin Gene Transcription</head><p>Cohesin is a multifunction protein complex. During S phase and M phase, cohesin tethers two sister chromatids together and is essential for proper chromosome segregation in mitosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Peters et al., 2008)</ref>. In the G1 phase, cohesin is important for long-range chromosome interactions at promoters, enhancers, and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF)-occupied insulator elements. Our CRISPR screen identified two cohesin proteins, Smc3 and Pds5b, as negative regulators, but intriguingly, cohesin loading factors Mau2 and Nipbl were identified as positive insulin regulators (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). In the mammalian genome, Nipbl mainly binds to promoters and enhancers, while the strongest peaks of cohesin are at intergenic CTCF sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Busslinger et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kagey et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zuin et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the cohesin loading complex may play a direct role regulating gene transcription independent of the CTCF-bound cohesin or mitotic cohesin <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Zuin et al., 2014)</ref>. Consistent with these findings, we found that Mau2 and Nipbl bind to Ins2 promoter, and the transcription level of Ins2, rather than Ins1, was lower upon Mau2 or Nipbl deletion (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>). Our singlecell data demonstrated that in human islets, MAU2 is expressed at higher levels in Î² cells than in other cell types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>). Interestingly, from the 171 human pancreas samples collected by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (GTEx Consortium, 2015), we found a significant positive correlation between the transcription of MAU2 and INS gene (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7D</ref>). Taken together, our results suggested a Î²-cell-specific function of cohesin loading factors in regulating insulin gene transcription. These results may also shed light on the mechanism of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), which has been linked to protein mutations in NIPBL and cohesin complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Liu and Baynam, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liu et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NuA4/Tip60 HAT Complex Regulates Insulin Secretion</head><p>We were interested in the Î² cell function of NuA4/Tip60 HAT complex module because Kat5 and Dmap1 were the strongest hits from our CRISPR screen (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>), suggesting a direct insulin regulatory function. The best-characterized function of the NuA4/Tip60 complex is transcriptional activation by acetylation of histones H4 and H2A. However, this trans-activity cannot explain the increase of intracellular insulin level upon deletion of NuA4/Tip60 complex members Kat5, Dmap1, and Brd8 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7F</ref>). We therefore tested the possibility that the NuA4/Tip60 complex may control insulin secretion. First, we observed compromised GSIS when treating either MIN6 cells or primary human islets with NU9056, a KAT5-specific acetyl-transferase inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Coffey et al., 2012)</ref>. Acetate can enhance GSIS, presumably by increasing the cellular level of acetyl-CoA, the substrate of all acetyl-transferases including KAT5 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7E</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Shimazu et al., 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, deletion of NuA4/Tip60 complex proteins (Kat5, Dmap1, and Brd8) as well as known insulin secretion regulators (Glp1r, Gnas, and Stxbp1) all led to accumulation of intracellular insulin, lower baseline insulin secretion, and GSIS defect (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7F-7H</ref>). As a control, deletion of positive regulator Mau2 and Nipbl did not affect glucose responses. Interestingly, the baseline insulin secretion from Mau2 and Nipbl knockout cells increased (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7G</ref>); the reason remains elusive because knocking out these two proteins may cause widespread effects on gene transcription, genome architecture, and cell cycle. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the acetyltransferase activity of NuA4/Tip60 complex is key for insulin secretion from Î² cell. It will be interesting to elucidate the downstream targets of NuA4/Tip60 complex responsible for insulin release.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION Higher Throughput Single-Cell Analysis</head><p>We have performed an in-depth analysis of 39,905 single islet cell transcriptome from nine human donors. To our knowledge, this is the largest single-cell transcriptome dataset in primary human islets. The data of identified cell types and their signature genes will serve as a valuable resource to understand islet cell differentiation and disease development. Due to improved throughput, we achieved high sensitivity and robustness to detect rare cell subpopulations, such as the proliferating Î± cells. We also observed a few rare cell subpopulations that are relatively individual-specific; more donors are necessary to obtain a comprehensive picture of endocrine cell heterogeneity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Highly Sensitive RePACT Algorithm Identifies Disease-Specific Cellular Changes</head><p>Obesity and T2D are two highly related diseases that share many common characteristics. Understanding the commonality and differences between the two diseases can be challenging because many patients have both diseases. To address this challenge, we developed RePACT, a general single-cell analysis algorithm to identify disease relevant genes with high sensitivity. Similar to several published single-cell analysis methods in differentiation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Trapnell et al., 2014)</ref>, the key step of RePACT is to determine a series of pseudo states best reflecting disease-relevant variance. By doing this, RePACT can discern a continuous disease trajectory that is too subtle to be detected from bulk analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). In this study, with merely nine donors, RePACT defined different trajectories for obesity and T2D and further identified numerous common and specific signature genes in b cells. We believe that the use of RePACT in future single-cell studies with more donors will significantly improve the sensitivity and robustness. The RePACT strategy is applicable to the studies of many other human diseases, especially when the sample availability is an issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integration of Genome-wide CRISPR Analyses to Reveal Disease-Contributing Genes and Pathways</head><p>Recent development of CRISPR-based genome editing has enabled pooled genome-wide screens in mammalian cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gilbert et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Konermann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Parnas et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shalem et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wang et al., 2014)</ref>. In this study, in order to reveal the functions of Î² cell signature genes from Drop-Seq data, we also performed an unbiased CRISPR screen for insulin regulators. Simply using resting-state intracellular insulin level as a readout, our screen identified not only transcriptional and translational regulators, but also numerous genes that control energy production, protein folding, vesicle trafficking, etc., suggesting that insulin production and release is controlled by a highly complex network. Importantly, the integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptome and CRISPR screen data highlighted potential causal genes in diabetes or obesity disease development, among which we have identified the Mau2-Nipbl cohesin loading complex and the NuA4/Tip60 HAT complex as two previously unrecognized insulin regulating protein modules. We further revealed that the Mau2-Nipbl complex regulates insulin gene transcription, and a surprising role of the NuA4/ Tip60 HAT complex in regulating insulin protein release. Our study provides a general strategy for systematically characterizing diabetes genes in pancreatic islets, as well as disease genes in other complex tissues.</p></div>

Plasmids mixture were added to the cells after incubation for transfection. 6 hours after transfection, each plate of 293T cells were switched to 10 mL fresh complete medium. 3 days after transfection, cell medium containing viral particles was harvested, filtered through 0.45Î¼M Millipore filters. For individual CRISPR experiments, the crude viral supernatant were applied directly to infect cells. For large-scale viral infection, the viral supernatant was concentrated by centrifuging for 90 minutes at 25,000 rpm in 4Â°C. Virus pellets were washed once with ice-cold PBS before re-suspended in PBS with 1mM EDTA.</p><p>Measuring virus titers-Virus titers were determined by adding 1uL of a series of diluted virus to 1 million MIN6 cells in 12-well plates, with two wells for each viral dilution. To minimize proliferation, MIN6 cells were cultured in the medium with 1% FBS. 4 days after infection, for each viral concentration, one well of cells were selected with 4 Î¼g/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for two days. Living cells and dead cells were collected and count the viability of the cells. Total cell numbers for each dilution were also compared with the infected MIN6 cells without puromycin.</p><p>Lentiviral infection-For individual knockout, cells were seeded into 12 well plates (0.1 million per well) together with 300 Î¼L crude viral supernatant. For large-scale viral infection, 120 million cells were seeded into three multilayer plates (Nest, #731002, 870 cm2) together with concentrated GeCKO library virus; the ratio between cells and virus were calculated so that 60% of cells can be infected (MOI 0.92). 24 hours after transduction, cells were washed once with PBS and then cultured in fresh medium. 4 days after transduction, cells were selected with 4 Î¼g/ml puromycin for two days. After selection, a portion of cells were fixed as input control and the rest cells were expanded. For large scale screening, ~200 million cells were fixed in permeabilization/fixation buffer (BD Biosciences) after expansion.</p><p>Flow cytometry and cell sorting-For flow cytometry, cells were seeded into 24 well plates at a density of 0.5 million/cm2. On the second day, for each well, cells were trypsinated and washed once with PBS. Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 minutes and permeabilized in Perm/ Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) for 40 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then stained with Insulin antibodies, rat IgG (R&amp;D Systems) at 1:100 dilution in 50 ul Perm/Wash buffer in 4Â°C overnight. On the second day, cells were washed once with Perm/Wash buffer and stained with PE-conjugated anti-rat IgG secondary antibodies at 1:200 dilution in 50 ul Perm/Wash buffer at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark. Cells were then washed once with PBS and analyzed in BD LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences).</p><p>Library preparation-Genomic DNA was extracted from cells using Dneasy Blood &amp; Tissloue Kit (QIAGEN). All sgRNA expressing cassettes within the genomic DNA are amplified from genomic DNA using mutual GeCKO primers (See Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). For each PCR amplification reaction, no more than 3 Î¼g genomic DNA were amplified with Herculase II (Agilent) polymerase for 15 cycles. For each sample, all the PCR products were pooled together and purified with Aline PCR Clean DX magnetic beads. Purified PCR products were then ligated to illumine TruSeq adapters. Ligation products were purified before second-round PCR amplification using TruSeq D&amp;E primers (Illumina) for 10 cycles. The resulting DNA libraries were then sequenced with standard TruSeq sequencing primers.</p><p>Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion-For MIN6 cells, 0.5 million cells per well were seeded into 12-well plates. For fresh islet samples, approximately 200 islets were seeded into 24-well plate with ultralow attachment surface. We changed fresh medium 24 hours before glucose challenge. Four hours before glucose challenge, cells were starved in low glucose Krebs' buffer (NaCl 12.8 mM, KCl 0.48 mM, KH2PO4 0.12 mM, MgSO4 1.2 mM, CaCl2 0.25 mM, NaHCO3 5mM, HEPES 10 uM, 0.5% BSA, 1.6 mM glucose) for 4 hours before challenged with high/low (16.6 mM/1.6 mM) glucose in fresh Krebs' buffer for up to 6 rounds alternatively. In each round, the supernatant was harvested for insulin ELISA analysis. Cells were washed once with PBS before next round stimulation. After GSIS, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermal Fisher) to measure intracellular insulin level if necessary.</p><p>RNA extraction and real-time PCR-We used TRIzol (Invitrogen) for RNA preparation. RNA was pretreated with DNase I before reverse transcription with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following standard protocol. For quantitative PCR, 1 ul cDNA, 10 ul 2X PerfeCTa SYBR Green SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences), 8 ul H2O, and 1 ul premixed real-time PCR primers were mixed, and PCR reactions were performed in PTC-200 Thermal Cycler with Chromo4 Fluorescence detector (MJ Research). Relative gene expression were determined with ddCt methods.</p><p>Preparation of human pancreatic islet single cell-To dissociate islets into single cells, cells were washed once in HBSS (Sigma-aldrich, #6648) and incubated in Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, #AT104) at 37Â°C for 20-25 min. The islets were broken up gently with a 5 mL pipette every 5 min. When &gt; 95% of the islets were digested into single cells, PIM(S) medium were added to neutralize the Accutase. Single cells were washed again with HBSS and resuspended in HBSS at the concentration of 2 Ã 10 5 /mL for Drop-Seq analysis.</p><p>Drop-Seq-We performed Drop-Seq following the protocol as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Macosko et al., 2015)</ref>. Briefly, three pump-controlled syringes with cell suspension (200,000 cells/mL), barcoded beads in lysis buffer (200,000 beads/mL), and droplet generation oil were connected to a microfluidic device under microscope supervision. During droplets generation, we set the cell and bead flow speed at 4,000uL/hr, and the oil speed at 15,000uL/hr. The droplets were collected into 50mL falcon tubes (usually less than 5mL). Under this setting, most droplets had at most one beads or one cell. Following droplet breakage, we performed 1 st strand cDNA synthesis on beads following SMART-PCR protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Macosko et al., 2015)</ref>. Finally, the resulting full-length cDNA library were prepared for sequencing.</p><p>For mixing species Drop-seq experiments, we mixed equal number of HEK293 and 3T3 cells and load them to Drop-Seq at different cell density. We found that at 200 cells/uL, less than 1% STAMPs were from more than one cell (doublets) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1F</ref>). However, the rate of doublets usually increases when handling human tissues, most likely due to the incomplete digestion. We have therefore taken a few data filtering steps to remove potential doublets computationally (further discussed below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</head><p>Drop-Seq reads processing-We performed raw reads processing following the instructions described in the original Drop-Seq publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Macosko et al., 2015)</ref>. The sequenced Drop-Seq libraries yield 50-base paired-end reads (PE50). However, since only the first 20bp of read 1 is informative (base 1-12 cell barcode, base 13-20 UMI), we trimmed base 21-50 of read 1 before further analysis. We first remove all data with the quality score of read 1 (base 1-20) lower than 10. Read 2 was trimmed at 3â² end to remove ployA tails of at least 6 bases, and trimmed at 5â² if template switching oligo (TSO) adaptor sequence appears. Clean reads were then aligned to hg19 or mm9 using STAR with default settings. We only keep uniquely mapped reads on gene exons. We next filtered out PCR duplicates with the same coordinates, cell barcode, and UMI. We then grouped the reads by cell barcode, and generated the digital UMI-count matrix after counting transcripts for every genes with every cell barcode.</p><p>Distinguish cell barcodes with single cell transcriptomes-We defined STAMPs (single cell transcriptome attached to microparticles) as cell barcodes with significantly more reads than background. Under the Drop-Seq experimental settings, only 2~5% of beads are co-encapsulated with cells. Therefore, most cell barcodes only have a small number of transcripts from mRNA contamination during the bead breakage step. In order to distinguish STAMPs from empty beads, we examined the density plots of transcript counts for all cell barcodes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>). In all experiments, we observed a major peak from empty beads and a fat right tail representing STAMPs with single cell transcriptomes. We therefore took a simple approach by calculating mean (Î¼) and standard deviation (Ï) of the major peak assuming a Gaussian distribution. Any cell barcode with more than Î¼ + 2 * Ï transcripts were called as STAMPs.</p><p>Down-sampling sequencing data-Because the Drop-Seq libraries have different sequencing depth, we observed variable sensitivity in detecting transcripts / genes from each library (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>), which causes bias during the clustering or comparative analyses. We therefore took a down-sampling approach to normalize the sequencing depth. We first run raw data processing as described above using full data and estimate the total STAMP numbers for each donor. For down sampling, we only took a portion of reads from every library so that the average per-STAMP sequencing depth are similar. New UMI-count matrices were generated again for all donors after down sampling. We found that the normalization of sequencing depth resulted in cleaner clusters in t-SNE plot (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>). We only used the down-sampled data matrices when different donors need to be compared.</p><p>Cell type identification using unsupervised clustering-We designed a pipeline to determine the cell types of most STAMPs with high confidence using unsupervised clustering methods (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). First, we performed initial clustering analysis with the 11,920 top STAMPs with at least 1,000 transcripts after down sampling. It has been previously estimated that in human islets, &lt;0.1% endocrine cells are positive with more than one marker hormones (INS, GCG, PPY, SST, and GHRL). We therefore first filtered out 890 STAMPs (out of 12,810, or 6.9%) expressing two hormones (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1G</ref>) before clustering analysis. In this step, one STAMP is considered as doublets if it has two hormone genes with 15 transcripts. As mentioned above, the percentage of doublets is significantly greater than estimated from species mix experiment because single cells from tissues are more inclined to adhere with each other than cultured cells.</p><p>For clustering, we first ranked top 10,000 genes based on average expression level among all cells; then grouped them into 10 bins with 1,000 genes each. Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for every gene within each bin. From every bin, we pick top 50 genes with highest CV as informative genes. All together, we picked 500 informative genes for clustering analysis. We used Seurat package for clustering analysis with default parameters. In Seurat, PCA was performed with the 500 informative genes. Using PC1 to PC10, cells were embedded in a K-nearest neighbor (KNN graph). Smart local moving algorithm (SLM) was applied to group cells into communities. PC1 to PC10 were used as input to visualize cell clusters in two-dimensional t-SNE space. In order to define cell type, we used Seurat FindMarker function to find marker genes of each cell cluster, and defined cell types based on our knowledge and literatures. We performed the first-round clustering to classify nonendocrine cells (ductal cells, active PSCs and quiescent PSCs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) and the second round to distinguish the endocrine cell types (Î±, Î², Î´, PP cells, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>). Acinar and Îµ cells are not distinguishable in t-SNE plot due to scarcity, but can be clearly recognized from PCA plots (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-2D</ref>). We also noticed a very small number of STAMPs (223, or 1.8%) expressing hormone genes inconsistent with their cell type classification (&gt; 15 transcripts) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1H</ref>), which were also filtered as possible doublets after clustering analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). Finally, we successfully assigned unique cell types to 11,697 STAMPs with high confidence (Data S1). We used the same method for other clustering analyses in this work.</p><p>Cell type identification of low-depth STAMPs-Finally, we classified the lowtranscript STAMPs using the knowledge obtained from clustering the top STAMPs as training dataset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). As mentioned above, we performed PCA clustering of the training dataset using 500 informative genes. From the PCA results, we took 32 significant principle components (PCs) as "knowledge" learned from training set. The 32 PCs are linear combinations of the 500 informative genes, and compose a virtual 32-dimensional space. Each cell type should form a cluster in the space. We next calculated the arithmetic centers of 8 cell types from training dataset (ductal, acinar, PSC, Î±, Î², Î´, Îµ, PP cells), and built spheres for all cell types centered at their arithmetic mean in the 32-dimentional space. We also computed the Euclidian distance between every cell to the center of its cell type, and empirically defined the radius of each "cell type sphere" as 80 percentile of all the distances in this cell type. For any low depth STAMP, we also took the same 500 informative genes, computed its projection onto the 32 PCs from training data, and the distances between the STAMP and the centers of all cell type spheres. If one STAMP is located exclusively in one cell type's "sphere," we will annotate the STAMP to that cell type. We also performed several filtering steps similar to training set, and successfully classified 16,329 additional STAMPs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). Lastly, we used 2-dimensional PCA plots and visually confirmed the correctness of cell type assignment (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-2D</ref>).</p><p>Differential expression analysis-Negative binomial (NB) distribution was often used in differentially expression (DE) analysis, for counts data with over-dispersion. Here, we assume that for any gene in a given cell, the transcripts number, UMI, can be modeled using NB distribution.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">logUMI = Î² 0 + Î² C C + Î² D D + log(s f )</formula><p>UMI is the expected value of UMI;</p><p>Î² 0 is the intercept, and Î² C and Î² D is the slope for C and D;</p><p>C stands for cell type, which is a categorical variable; D stands for donor, which is a categorical variable. This variable was used to regress out the donor specific effect;</p><p>sf stands for size factor, which is use to normalized the single cell transcriptome. It mainly corrects the sequencing depth of each cell (total transcript counts of a cell). However, the size factor can be biased due to the dropout zeros, therefore needs further correction. In this study, we calculated sf using the computeSumFactor function in a Bioconductor package scran <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lun et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>We performed pairwise comparison between any two cell types based on the negative binomial model described above. For every gene, we perform the regression analysis using the generalized linear model function glm.nb in the R package MASS. The p value of pairwise cell type specificity of any gene is provided by the function as the significance of Î² C . The p values of all genes were further adjusted with Bioconductor package qvalue for to obtain q-values. We also computed two fold changes between the average transcript counts. Differentially expressed genes are defined when q-value &lt; 0.05, and ranked by fold changes.</p><p>Public databases-GWAS data were downloaded from GWAS catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(MacArthur et al., 2017)</ref>. We hand-picked 80 diabetes related traits and classified them into 5 categories: body measurements, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, Type I diabetes, and Type II diabetes. In total, 1,050 genes were retrieved. The list of transcription factors (TFs) is obtained from transcriptional factor prediction database (DBD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Wilson et al., 2008)</ref>. The list of cell surface protein was downloaded from a previous study (da <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cunha et al., 2009)</ref>. All these gene lists used in this study are included in Data S3.</p><p>RePACT-We developed RePACT (Regressing Principle components for the Assembly of Continuous Trajectory) as a general method to sensitively identify disease relevant gene signatures using single cell data. The key step is to find the best trajectory to rank single cells (e.g., Î² cells) reflecting the change of disease status. In this study, we used RePACT to study obesity (denoted by a continuous BMI variable) and T2D (denoted by a dichotomous variable T2D).</p><p>The first step of RePACT is dimension reduction. For example, we took Î² cells from all donors and perform PCA analysis. A number of principle components (PCs) will be identified and ranked by the percentage of variance they can explain. Each PC is a linear combination of genes. This allows us to convert every cell's transcriptome from a highdimensional vector (e.g., a vector of 10,000 genes) into a low-dimensional vector (e.g., a vector of top 10 PCs). In this study, we empirically picked top 10 PCs, while RePACT can be conveniently run with more or fewer PCs.</p><p>We next performed linear regression for the continuous variable BMI:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">BMI = Î² 0 + â i = 1 10 Î² i * PC i</formula><p>BMI is the expected BMI value;</p><p>Î² 0 is the intercept, and Î² i , is the slope of each PCs;</p><p>PC i is the i th principle component of a cell.</p><p>With the regressed Î² values, we computed the BMI-index for every cell, which is the predicted BMI value from the model. The BMI-index was used to rank the cells, and its value indicates how far a cell is transformed toward obesity status.</p><p>For dichotomous variable (True / False) indicating whether a cell is from T2D donor, we used a logistic regression model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">logit(p T2D ) = Î² 0 + â i = 1 10 Î² i * PC i</formula><p>p T2D is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the risk of a cell been from T2D donor;</p><p>Î² 0 is the intercept, and Î² i is the slope of each PCs;</p><p>PC i is the i th principle component of a cell.</p><p>With the regressed Î² values, we computed the T2D-index for every cell, which is the predicted logit(p T2D ) value from the model. The T2D-index was used to rank the cells, and its value indicates how far a cell is transformed toward T2D status.</p><p>In order to identify genes associated with obesity or T2D trajectory. We grouped all cells into 20 bins with equal BMI-or T2D-index intervals; every bin contains hundreds of single cells. For every gene, we then calculated the average transcript counts from cells in each bin and obtained a vector of 20 values. A simple linear regression was performed between the average transcript counts and the index values of the bins with p value. The p values of all genes were adjusted with Bioconductor package qvalue to obtain q-values. Genes with qvalue less than 0.05 were called significant trajectory genes.</p><p>Raw CRISPR screen sequencing data analysis-Raw FASTQ files were analyzed with FASTX-Toolkit (Hannon's Lab). sgRNA sequences were aligned to GeCKO library sequences with Bowtie2.</p><p>Guide-RNA level CRISPR screen data analysis-We performed two independent screens to evaluate the reproducibility of every sgRNA. Partly because late-passaging MIN6 cells grows slow and may also start to lose their insulin secretion ability, we performed two independent viral-transduction to reduce the time needed for cell expansion. It should be noted that this "viral-transduction replication" strategy is in contrast to "split-plate replication," in which the viral infected cells are split into multiple cultures after expansion for replicate experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5A</ref>). Most CRISPR screen papers we examined, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hart et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kanarek et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shalem et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou et al., 2014)</ref>, used the "split-plate" strategy; "viral-transduction replication" strategy was also used in several (but fewer) papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Koike-Yusa et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Korkmaz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Shifrut et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Statistically, the two replication strategies have drastically different error-structures. For our "viral-transduction replication" strategy, we have to consider the viral infection variability between the two experiments. For example, assuming the sequencing depth in all libraries are the same, a significant sgRNA may show 2-fold change in one replicate experiment between InsLo and InsHi population at 200 versus 100 reads with p &lt;0.001; in another replicate the same sgRNA may merely show 20 versus 10 reads with marginal p value due to viral infection variability. The proper way to handle this type of variation is to do pairwise comparison for every sgRNA in each experiment separately; then examine if the enriched/ depleted sgRNA is reproducible between two experiments. We performed the following steps for sgRNA level analysis:</p><p>Step 1: For every sgRNA in each of the replicates, we used binomial tests to calculate the p values for the difference of abundance between InsHi and InsLo cell populations (with MAGeCK package inR). The p values of all sgRNAs in the two replicates are listed in Data S5. We setup three significance levels for p values (&lt; 0.05, &lt; 0.01, or &lt; 0.001); in step 2 we will keep a sgRNA only if it is significantly enriched or depleted in both replicates.</p><p>Step 2: To determine how reproducible a sgRNA is, we further classified all sgRNAs into 5 groups based on their p values in two replicates. Step 3: To further assess the FDR of the sgRNAs, we randomly shuffled the data from all sgRNA in each replicated screen for 100 times, and compute the FDR of tier 1 through tier 5 sgRNAs with different criteria (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). According to this analysis, our tier 1 sgRNAs achieved FDR of 0.1; sgRNAs in other tiers can be also valuable although to a lesser extent.</p><p>Gene-level CRISPR screen data analysis-Since an off-target sgRNA can be also reproducible between replicate screens, it is important to perform gene level analysis examine the effect of different sgRNAs targeting the same gene. The GeCKO library has 6 sgRNAs for each gene, which provide redundancy for reproducibility test at gene level. However, many guides may not achieve statistical significance due to variation in library construction, viral transduction, cell sorting procedure, sequencing depth, etc. Additionally, some guide may not be potent enough or abundant enough in the library to cause detectable effects, especially when the number of sorted cells is relatively small. In this study, as mentioned before, we have to harvest cells as early as possible after virus transduction because late-passaging MIN6 cells grows slower and may also start to lose their insulin secretion ability, limiting the number of cells we can analyze. Therefore, our philosophy for gene level analysis is: (i) we certainly prefer genes with multiple supporting sgRNA; (ii) we can also accept hit genes with neutral guide RNAs; (iii) we prohibit a hit gene to have contradictory sgRNAs.</p><p>The following rules were applied for gene-level analysis:</p><p>â¢ Tier 1-5 sgRNAs from Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> were all considered "supporting" sgRNA.</p><p>â¢ Tier 1 hit gene must have at least one Tier 1 sgRNA; Tier 2 hit gene must have at least one Tier 2 sgRNA. We did not report tier 3-5 genes since their best sgRNAs are weak; in fact, we only used Tier 1 hit genes for follow-up analysis in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>A hit gene cannot have contradictory sgRNAs. i.e., a hit gene cannot be classified as "enrichment" and "depletion" by two guides at the same time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>After filtering, the rest Tier 1 and 2 hit genes were further classified into sub-tiers based on the number of supporting sgRNAs (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>On randomly shuffled data (the p values of sgRNAs are shuffled in each experiment), we simulate all the aforementioned gene-level rules to estimate the FDR for hit genes (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). As expected, the FDR of genes supported by 2 or more sgRNAs is extremely low.</p><p>We summarized the results of all tier 1 and tier 2 genes in the "collapse_to_gene" sheet of Data S5. As expected, genes supported by tier 1 sgRNAs are also more likely to be supported by multiple sgRNAs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5D</ref>). The strong FDRs of Tier 1A, 1B, and 2A genes clearly indicate that genes with multiple supporting sgRNAs are high-confidence hits. We chose to report Tier 1C genes in this paper because for these genes, we are fairly certain      Top insulin regulator genes from CRISPR screen were analyzed by search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes or proteins (STRING).

(C) Left: comparison of the BMI index values of cells from each donor; the color of the violin plots represents the actual BMI of each donor. Right: comparison of the T2D index distribution of each donor. The color of the plots represents the T2D status of the donors. Vertical dash lines demonstrate how cells are binned into pseudostates. (D) Heatmaps demonstrating the top obesity trajectory genes (left) and T2D trajectory genes (right). Each row in the heatmaps represent the transcriptional changes from low-index pseudostates to high-index pseudostates. (E) Venn diagram showing the overlap between obesity and T2D signature genes identified from RePACT analyses.
